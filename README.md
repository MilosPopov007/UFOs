# UFOs
Creating a Dynamic Web Page using the JavaScript programming language with UFOs table data, that will react to user input and customizing HTML file with CSS Bootstrap for easy viewing


## Results:

The main goal of this project is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. In order to do that I built the web page that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

In a first step the storyboard was created as a kind of blueprint for the website and JavaScript code follows along by importing the data and then referencing it with a variable.
